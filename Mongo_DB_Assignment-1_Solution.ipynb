    "##### > MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that           one want with the querying and indexing that one needs.\n",
    "##### > Non-relational databases (often called NoSQL databases) are different from         traditional relational databases in that they store their data in a non-           tabular form. Instead, non-relational databases might be based on data             structures like documents. A document can be highly detailed while                 containing a range of different types of information in different formats.         This ability to digest and organize various types of information side by           side makes non-relational databases much more flexible than relational             databases.\n",
    "##### > Applications must be able to query data efficiently and deliver results           almost instantly. Non-relational databases are a natural choice for this           kind of environment. They offer both security and agility, allowing for           rapid development of applications in an agile environment. Easier and less         complex to manage than relational databases, they can also yield lower             data management costs while providing superior performance and speed.\n",
    "##### > A natural fit for agile development, non-relational databases can                 accommodate the complexity of data inputs more efficiently than structured         databases. In an age of increasing data complexity, non-relational                 databases provide the flexibility in database design that has become               increasingly indispensable. Especially when paired with the cloud, non-           relational databases lift the limits on your data collection,                     organization, and analysis, allowing you to get the most out of your data.\n",

    "###### >> When dealing with particularly large datasets, sharding—the process of             splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed collections, or             “shards”—helps the database distribute and better execute what might               otherwise be problematic and cumbersome queries. Without sharding,                 scaling a growing web application with millions of daily users is nearly           impossible.\n",
